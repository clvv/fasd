.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Fad keeps track of files and directories you access in your shell and
gives you quick access to them.
You can use fad to reference files or directories by just a few key
identifying characters.
You can use fad to boost your command line productivity by defining
your own aliases to launch programs on files or directories.
Fad, by default, provides some basic aliases, including a shell
function "z" that resembles the functionality of "z" and "autojump."
.PP
The name "fad" comes from the default suggested aliases
\f[C]f\f[](files), \f[C]a\f[](files/directories),
\f[C]s\f[](show/search/select), \f[C]d\f[](directories).
.PP
Fad ranks files and directories by "frecency," that is, by both
"frequency" and "recency." The term "frecency" was first coined by
Mozilla and used in Firefox.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
z\ bundle
f\ \-e\ vim\ nginx\ conf
f\ \-i\ rc$
vi\ `f\ nginx\ conf`
cp\ update.html\ `d\ www`
open\ `sf\ pdf`

.fi
.SH SHELL INITIALIZATION
.PP
To get fad working in a shell, some initialization code must be run.
Put lines below in your POSIX compatible shell rc.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval\ "$(fad\ \-\-init\ auto)"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will setup a command hook that executes on every command and
advanced tab completion for zsh and bash.
.PP
If you want more control over what gets into your shell environment, you
can pass customized set of arguments to \f[C]fad\ \-\-init\f[].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
zsh\-hook\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ define\ _fad_preexec\ and\ add\ it\ to\ zsh\ preexec\ array
zsh\-ccomp\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ zsh\ command\ mode\ completion\ definitions
zsh\-ccomp\-install\ \ \ \ #\ setup\ command\ mode\ completion\ for\ zsh
zsh\-wcomp\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ zsh\ word\ mode\ completion\ definitions
zsh\-wcomp\-install\ \ \ \ #\ setup\ word\ mode\ completion\ for\ zsh
bash\-hook\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ add\ hook\ code\ to\ bash\ $PROMPT_COMMAND
bash\-ccomp\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ bash\ command\ mode\ completion\ definitions
bash\-ccomp\-install\ \ \ #\ setup\ command\ mode\ completion\ for\ bash
posix\-alias\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ define\ aliases\ that\ applies\ to\ all\ posix\ shells
posix\-hook\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ setup\ $PS1\ hook\ for\ shells\ that\[aq]s\ posix\ compatible
tcsh\-alias\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ define\ aliases\ for\ tcsh
tcsh\-hook\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ #\ setup\ tcsh\ precmd\ alias
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Example for a minimal zsh setup (no tab completion):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
eval\ "$(fad\ \-\-init\ posix\-alias\ zsh\-hook)"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note that this method will slightly increase your shell start\-up time,
since calling binaries has overhead.
You can cache fad init code if you want minimal overhead.
Example code for bash (to be put into .bashrc):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
fad_cache="$HOME/.fad\-init\-bash"
if\ [\ "$(command\ \-v\ fad)"\ \-nt\ "$fad_cache"\ \-o\ !\ \-s\ "$fad_cache"\ ];\ then
\ \ fad\ \-\-init\ posix\-alias\ bash\-hook\ bash\-ccomp\ bash\-ccomp\-install\ >|\ "$fad_cache"
fi
source\ "$fad_cache"
unset\ fad_cache
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Optionally, if you can also source \f[C]fad\f[] if you want
\f[C]fad\f[] to be a shell function instead of an executable.
.PP
You can tweak initialization code.
For instance, if you want to use "c" instead of "z" to do directory
jumping, you can use the alias below:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
alias\ c=\[aq]fad_cd\ \-d\[aq]
#\ `\-d\[aq]\ option\ present\ for\ bash\ completion
#\ function\ fad_cd\ is\ defined\ in\ posix\-alias
\f[]
.fi
.SH MATCHING
.PP
Fad has three matching modes: default, case\-insensitive, and fuzzy.
.PP
For a given set of queries (the set of command\-line arguments passed to
fad), a path is a match if and only if:
.IP "1." 3
Queries match the path in order.
.IP "2." 3
The last query matches the last segment of the path.
.PP
If no match is found, fad will try the same process ignoring case.
If still no match is found, fad will allow extra characters to be
placed between query characters for fuzzy matching.
.PP
Tips:
.IP \[bu] 2
If you want your last query not to match the last segment of the path,
append `/\[aq] as the last query.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you want your last query to match the end of the filename, append
`$\[aq] to the last query.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Fad\[aq]s basic functionalities are POSIX compliant, meaning that you
should be able to use fad in all POSIX compliant shells.
Your shell need to support command substitution in $PS1 in order for
fad to automatically track your commands and files.
This feature is not specified by the POSIX standard, but it\[aq]s
nonetheless present in many POSIX compliant shells.
In shells without prompt command or prompt command substitution (tcsh
for instance), you can add entries manually with "fad \-A".
You are very welcomed to contribute shell initialization code for not
yet supported shells.
.SH TAB COMPLETION
.PP
Fad offers two completion modes, command mode completion and word mode
completion.
Command mode completion works in bash and zsh.
Word mode completion only works in zsh.
.PP
Command mode completion is just like completion for any other commands.
It is triggered when you hit tab on a fad command or its aliases.
Under this mode your queries can be separated by a space.
Tip: if you find that the completion result overwrites your queries,
type an extra space before you hit tab.
.PP
Word mode completion can be triggered on \f[I]any\f[] command.
Word completion is triggered by any command line argument that starts
with "," (all), "f," (files), or "d," (directories), or that ends with
",," (all), ",,f" (files), or ",,d" (directories).
Examples:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ vim\ ,rc,lo<Tab>
$\ vim\ /etc/rc.local

$\ mv\ index.html\ d,www<Tab>
$\ mv\ index.html\ /var/www/
\f[]
.fi
.PP
There are also three zle widgets: "fad\-complete", "fad\-complete\-f",
"fad\-complete\-d".
You can bind them to keybindings you like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
bindkey\ \[aq]^X^A\[aq]\ fad\-complete\ \ \ \ #\ C\-x\ C\-a\ to\ do\ fad\-complete\ (fils\ and\ directories)
bindkey\ \[aq]^X^F\[aq]\ fad\-complete\-f\ \ #\ C\-x\ C\-f\ to\ do\ fad\-complete\-f\ (only\ files)
bindkey\ \[aq]^X^D\[aq]\ fad\-complete\-d\ \ #\ C\-x\ C\-d\ to\ do\ fad\-complete\-d\ (only\ directories)
\f[]
.fi
.SH BACKENDS
.PP
Fad can take advantage of different sources of recent / frequent files.
Most desktop environments (such as OS X and Gtk) and some editors (such
as Vim) keep a list of accessed files.
Fad can use them as additional backends if the data can be converted
into fad\[aq]s native format.
Below is a list of available backends.
.IP \[bu] 2
spotlight: OSX spotlight, provides entries that are changed today or
opened within the past month
.IP \[bu] 2
recently\-used: GTK\[aq]s recently\-used file (Usually available on
Linux)
.IP \[bu] 2
current: Provides everything in $PWD (whereever you are executing
\f[C]fad\f[])
.IP \[bu] 2
viminfo: Vim\[aq]s editing history, useful if you want to define an
alias just for editing things in vim
.PP
You can define your own backend by declaring a function by that name in
your \f[C]\&.fadrc\f[].
You can set default backend with \f[C]_FASD_BACKENDS\f[] variable in our
\f[C]\&.fadrc\f[].
.SH TWEAKS
.PP
Upon every execution, fad will source "/etc/fadrc" and "$HOME/.fadrc"
if they are present.
Below are some variables you can set:
